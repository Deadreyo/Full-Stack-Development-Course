Welcome to my submission of Project 1 - Image Processing API

This project resizes images to the desired width/height.

It has 5 available images: image1, image2, image3, image4, image5.

The list is also shown in /api page.

To start, simply go to '/api/' followed by image name like 'image3' followed
by the needed width and height '?width=#&height=#'
Ex: '/api/image4?width=500&height=300'

@note: If width & height are not given, they will default to 400, 300.
